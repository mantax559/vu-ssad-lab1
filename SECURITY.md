# Security Policy

We are committed to keeping our project secure and appreciate responsible reporting of vulnerabilities. This document outlines our security reporting policy and how to notify us of potential issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: Avoid creating a public issue in the repository to disclose security vulnerabilities, as it could expose the issue before a fix is available.

2. **Submit a Private Report**: Please submit a **Security Advisory** by going to the repository's "Security" tab, selecting "Report a Vulnerability" and following the instructions. [Learn more about GitHub Security Advisories.](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)

3. **Include Detailed Information**:
    - Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
    - Include steps to reproduce the issue, if known.
    - Indicate any perceived impact or severity level.
    - (Optional) Suggest potential fixes or mitigations.

4. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours**. We will communicate with you about the status, resolution progress and any additional information requests.

5. **Disclosure Policy**: Once the issue is addressed, we will work with you on a coordinated public disclosure timeline, giving you appropriate credit unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
